Web Navigator AI Agent
An intelligent AI-powered web navigation agent that combines planning, automation, and reasoning to interact with websites, extract information, and perform multi-step tasks automatically.

This project integrates LLM-based planning with a stealth browser automation engine, enabling seamless execution of user instructions such as:

Searching for information online

Extracting structured data

Comparing results

Automating repetitive browsing tasks

🚀 Features
LLM Planner – Converts natural language instructions into step-by-step executable plans.

Browser Automation – Stealth browser (Selenium/Playwright-based) that executes actions invisibly.

Task Orchestration – Middleware connects planning and automation with multi-step reasoning.

Extensible Design – Easy to add new actions and custom workflows.

Memory Module (optional) – Store and recall past tasks for better context handling.

🛠 Tech Stack
Python 3.10+

Large Language Model (LLM) – Local/OpenAI-compatible parser

Selenium / Playwright – For browser automation

JSON-based planning layer – Structured step execution

Custom Orchestration Middleware

3. Run the agent
python -m agent.web_navigator_agent
🧩 Example Usage
Instruction:

"Search for the top 5 AI startups in 2025, extract their websites, and return as a JSON list."

Agent Workflow:

Parse instruction → Plan steps in JSON.

Launch browser → Perform search.

Extract company names & websites.

Return structured JSON response.

Sample Output:

[
  {"name": "Startup A", "website": "https://a.com"},
  {"name": "Startup B", "website": "https://b.com"}
]
🔮 Roadmap
 Add support for more automation actions (form-filling, login, scraping tables).

 Integrate vector memory for long-term task context.

 Web UI dashboard for real-time monitoring.

 Plugin support for third-party APIs.
